Function Calling
Taking advantage of OpenAI's NLP and the new function calling capabilities introduced for users. By utilizing AI, it takes away the need of having to filter out certain keywords, and removes the tediousness of having to parse and format data. 

Core Functionality
At the core of this code is the integration of NLP techniques with OpenAI's function calling capabilities. By constructing a coherent natural language prompt, the code effectively communicates the user's intent to the API. The prompt combines both system and user messages to ensure contextually relevant responses.
Implementation Steps

    Natural Language Prompt: The code begins by crafting a natural language prompt that outlines the task's requirements: summarizing weather conditions and suggesting an outfit based on location data.

    User Message Inclusion: JSON-formatted location details are seamlessly included in the user message portion of the prompt. This dynamic integration ensures that the generated response is tailored to the provided data.

    Function Calling: Leveraging OpenAI's function calling feature, the code sends the constructed prompt to the API. The response is generated based on the prompt's context, resulting in a concise summary and outfit recommendation.
